# Models Directory

This directory stores trained machine learning models and related artifacts.

## Model Storage

- Trained model files (`.pkl`, `.joblib`, `.h5`, etc.)
- Model configuration files
- Feature importance data
- Model performance metrics
- Cross-validation results

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names for model files:
- `linear_regression_v1.pkl`
- `random_forest_tuned.joblib`
- `xgboost_final_model.pkl`
- `lightgbm_optimized.txt`

## Model Versioning

Consider including:
- Model version
- Training date
- Performance metrics
- Feature set used
