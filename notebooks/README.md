## Suggested Notebook Structure

1. `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Initial data exploration and quality assessment
2. `02_eda.ipynb` - Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
3. `03_feature_engineering.ipynb` - Feature creation and transformation
4. `04_modeling.ipynb` - Model training and evaluation
5. `05_model_interpretation.ipynb` - Feature importance and model interpretation
6. `06_final_results.ipynb` - Final results and conclusions

Each notebook should be well-documented with markdown cells explaining the analysis steps and findings.
